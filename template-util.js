These loans generally have a fixed rate of interest and are paid over a fixed term, just like your original mortgage.',

Repayment terms can vary and in some cases, there can be a balloon payment due at the end of the loan term. The interest rate might also be variable.',

If they run into financial difficulties that prevent them from making the required payments they may be putting their home at risk.
